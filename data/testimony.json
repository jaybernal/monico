I absolutely could not ask more from his training and guidance, on top of the countless of selfles hours he puts in with my pup. Thank you Monico dog training!"

Did a great job. Recommend everyone come out & experience a learning experience for yourself & your dog. Looking forward to next Saturday."

I can honestly say I have learned a ton from him from training to behaviors and how best to work with my dogs to curve those unwanted behaviors and would definitely recommend to hire. I actually leaned about him from friends who used him and recognized the name that many owners in the dog talk were talking about and how great of a job he does."
